# Cloudknife 
Python based CLI wrapper for interacting with AWS through the console 

# Requirements
You will need at the very minimum the following: 
* Homebrew installed (http://brew.sh will give you instructions on installation) -- you're on your own if you have a windows box (if you set this up and wanna contribute back to the readme, feel free) 
* A working knowledge of python 3
* Python 3 installed (`brew install python3`) 
* Pip 8.1.2 or higher (untested with lower versions of pip, it may still work)
* Python3 installed on your system (Untested / Unsupported on Python < 3.X.X) 
* The ability to read code most likely as this documentation could possibly get out of date 
* Understanding of pip and how it works to resolve any dependency issues you may encounter 

# Installation of Dependencies 
In order to install the dependencies needed, simply run the following commnad: 
```
# will intstall the pip modules in the requirements.txt file to your python modules directory 
# If the below command fails, you may need to use sudo (look into whether or not you actually wanna do that given your use case) 
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

# Usage
To use the application, simply utilize the following command (the `cloudknife` file needs to be executable `chmod u+x`) 
```
# REPOSITORY_ROOT implies the root of this repo 
cd ${REPOSITORY_ROOT} 
./cloudknife 
```

* It takes time and money to stand up resources in the cloud to test the underlying source code.  All of these expenses are currently covered by myself out of pocket.  If you or your organization have gained benefit from this project and have the ability to either contribute back some source code (either a feature of an improvement to existing code [i.e. nothing is discouraged, all improvements are highly encouraged]).  Nevertheless, that being said.  The project is licensed under the MIT license which essentially means you can take this source code, make a small few changes, and so long as you abide by the MIT license terms you may do whatever you wish :) (DISCLAIMER: Not a lawyer, nothing should be construed as legal advice)
